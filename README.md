# AirQualityBot
[AirQualityBot](https://bsky.app/profile/airqbot.klosko.net)

BlueSky bot for posting AirQuality news and daily reports

## AirQualityRepostBot

This script will periodically go through the profiles of accounts that follow the robot's profile (Opt-IN), and if their posts contain defined keywords - hashtags - it will repost the post.

## AirQualityBot

This script regularly sends daily reports and graphs from my two [Air Quality Monitors](https://www.klosko.net/blog/=stitek=air-quality#airqmonitor) once a day
The second function is sending reports in case the maximum daily average value is exceeded.
